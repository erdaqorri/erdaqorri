Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on modelling the 3D protein structures of cancer missense variants using AlphaFold2 and developing novel  ...
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning circRNA identification algorithms and structural biology
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on single-cell RNA-sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, predicting the impact of missense variants on protein function
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about proteins, cancer variants, and folding
